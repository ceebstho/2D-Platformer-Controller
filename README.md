# Platformer-Controller
An all in one platformer script based on most of bendux tutorials, but with my own modifications made to improve it.

The script itself has many modifiers which can be adjusted to suit different needs. 

Includes the following functions:
- Smooth movement (ground + aerial)
- Jump buffer
- Coyote time
- Multi-jumping (can be modified to have any amount of extra mid-air jumps)
- Dashing
- Wall sliding
- Wall jumping
- Gliding

A great starting point for 2d platformer games.

Made in mind with Unity 2D Games.
