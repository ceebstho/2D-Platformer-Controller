# Platformer-Controller
An all in one platformer script based on most of bendux tutorials, but with my own modifications made to improve it.

The script itself has many modifiers which can be adjusted to suit different needs. 

Includes the following functions:
- Smooth movement (ground + aerial)
- Double jumping
- Dashing
- Wall sliding
- Wall jumping
- Gliding

A great starting point for 2d platformer games.
